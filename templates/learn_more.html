                <p>Pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN) can find educational transitions difficult. 
                    SEN Passports are a simple communication tool that can help pupils and parents provide
                    Teachers with important and sometimes vital information about the transitioning pupil's 
                    needs and additional supports.
                </p>

                <p>
                    SEN Passports are just a small part of a pupil's transition support plan. 
                    The successful transition of an SEN pupil includes many other steps, including
                    parent teacher conferences, appropriate class placement, applications for resources
                    etc. 

                    It is precisley because they make up such a small part of this planning, that they are often
                    overlooked or regarded as an 'additional' or 'optional support. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is the intention of MyPSE.ie to provide a simple, efficient means for 
                    SEN schools, teachers, pupils and parents to create and organise SEN passports
                    whilst promoting the many benefits that using passports can provide.

                    <strong>*** PLEASE NOTE THE MyPSE.ie WEB APPLICATION WAS NOT DESIGNED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE NCSE,

                <p>
                    On their website, the National Council for Special Education describes many types of transitions 
                    that SEN pupils can make during thier time in education. These include:
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    Moving between Mainstream and Special Education
                    - Moving Between Primary and secondary School
                    - Changing Schools
                </p>
                <p>   
                    For more information about SEN Transitions you can check out the official NCSE support documents <a target="_blank" href="https://ncse.ie/transitions-2">here.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ideally, SEN passports should accompany a pupil when they first arrive at a new school.
                    They contain important indicators of a pupil's educational ability, emotional triggers, likes and personality,
                    as well as an overview of a pupil's social and communication skills.
                    
                    Many different frameworks and templates are used to provide as much background information
                    as possible that will help a teacher quickly understand and address the needs of any given pupil.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Here is an example of a template provided by the excellent 4schools Planner For Teachers of Special Education:
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to provide a sense or familiarity, MyPSE.ie has adapted the layout of this template to create our own custom user passport. 
                </p>
                 
                
                <p>
                    <h4>Why MyPSE.ie?</h4>
                    So why the need for this site?

                    First and foremost, any additional resource that becomes availiable to help SEN pupils during
                    educational transition should be welcome. MyPSE.ie however does have several features that will help 
                    improve the accessibility of SEN passports but also raise awareness of the importance and utility of the
                    resource as the site increased it's usership accross time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <h4>How Does it Work?</h4>

                    Firstly, Pupil's must be enrolled on the MyPSE.ie system to ensure all passports created are legitimate and that no more
                    than one passport can be created per pupil. Users with the roll of 'School' can easily Enroll pupils. When a pupil is enrolled
                    School administration staff can print off a pupil ID form and physically send it home with the pupil. The form will contain the users
                    Pupil ID and Teacher Number for the user to complete thier passport form.
                    
                    Secondly, Pupils or Parents can create and style passports by firstly, registering as parent or pupil users
                    and then confirming their pupil ID numbers. They include the teacher ID number when creating their passports. Provided by the School
                    Admin Staff, the teacher ID is what grants access to the pupil's passport.

                    Lastly, teachers can view pupil passports by registering an account then providing their unique teacher ID number. 
                    This number is will return a list of passports the teacher is authorised to view. For further security, the teacher must also provide the
                    pupil's pupil ID number before they can view the document.
                </p>
                    <br>
                <p>   
                    <h4>Uniformity</h4>

                    Because MyPSE.ie is availiable to everyone and can be easily accessed across many different platforms
                    it can offer a familiarity to its users and pupils can enjoy a continuity of service as they make transitions throughout
                    their educational life. As its usership grows Teachers will become more familiar with where to find specific information as 
                    the layout will always retain its fundamental structure.
                </p>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    <h4>Safe and Secure</h4>

                    MyPSE.ie puts the pupil and thier parents firmly in control of who gets to access their passport. Following GDPR guidelines
                    MyPSE.ie passports only allow one teacher to be assigned to a pupil at any given time. When a pupil or a parent changes the
                    teacher ID on a passport the previous teacher's access is immediately revoked.

                    There is also no way for anyone to create a passport without a valid Pupil ID number that will be physically provided via
                    your school admin.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <h4>Always availiable</h4>

                    Picture the scene. You're on a school trip with SEN pupils and one of the newly enrolled pupils seems to be upset. 
                    A traditional passport document would be back at school and inaccessable. With MyPSE.ie just logon via your smartphone 
                    and get the vital information you require to assist your SEN pupil.
                </p>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    <h4>Easily Editable</h4>

                    With a MyPSE.ie Pupil Passport you only have to make a passport once. Then it's just a matter of keeping your passport
                    updated as you (or your child) progresses through school.
                </p>
